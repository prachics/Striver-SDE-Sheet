# Striver SDE Sheet - Daily LeetCode Challenge

This repository contains my daily solutions to the **Striver's SDE Sheet** challenge, which is a curated list of the most commonly asked coding problems in top tech interviews (FANG and other product-based companies).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To solve **at least one LeetCode problem every day** and improve problem-solving skills, consistency, and interview readiness. Each solution is committed with:

- âœ… A Python solution file
- âœ… A detailed README per problem with explanation, approach, and complexities

---

## ðŸ§­ Structure

The problems are organized **topic-wise** (e.g., Arrays, Linked List, Stack) and inside each topic, each problem has its own folder:

## ðŸ“š What is Striver's SDE Sheet?

Striver's SDE Sheet is a set of hand-picked coding problems for Software Development Engineer (SDE) interviews created by [Take U Forward](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/).

It covers:
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy
- and more...

## ðŸš€ My Goal

- Build consistency with daily problem solving
- Understand brute force and optimal approaches
- Document everything clearly for future revision and public sharing
